# Audio_Recorder_Python

Welcome to the Audio Recorder Python repository! üéôÔ∏èüêç

## Description

This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates audio recording and playback using the `sounddevice` and `scipy.io.wavfile` libraries. With this script, you can easily record audio and save it as a WAV file. Whether you're curious about audio processing in Python or want to capture your creative ideas, this project provides an excellent starting point.

## Features

- Record audio with customizable duration.
- Set the sample rate for high-quality recordings.
- Save recorded audio as a WAV file.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/shriyaa01/Audio_Recorder_Python`.
2. Navigate to the repository: `cd audio.py`.
3. Install dependencies: `pip install sounddevice scipy`.
4. Run the script: `python audio.py`.
5. Enter the desired recording duration in seconds.
6. Listen to the recorded audio saved as `out.wav`.

## Dependencies

- [sounddevice](https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.1/): Provides audio input/output capabilities.
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/): Used for reading and writing WAV files.
